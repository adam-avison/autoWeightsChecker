Description:
Script to check relative weights of 7M and 12M ALMA data prior to joint deconvolution imaging.
To be run in CASA.
Usage:
User interaction is minimal, user defined input are listed under comment #=== USER INPUT ===#
and are:
do_outfile_print = True      #--- Allow printing of results to text file. [Boolean (True/False)]
do_commandline_print = False #--- Just for testing, print some results to command line.  [Boolean (True/False)]
do_plot = False              #--- Just for testing, plot some diagnostic plots (not very useful).  [Boolean (True/False)]
SPWS = ['0','1','2','3']     #--- Array of requested SPWs to check. [Array of strings]
fileType = 'contsub'         #--- Suffix of MS to use, e.g. 'ms', 'split.cal'. [String]
sourcePath = '/raid1/scratch/aavison/ALMAGAL/TEST_SAMPLE/sources/'  #--- Path to where the data is.
                                                                    #--- Expected directory structure is below. [String]
outfileName = 'CheckWeights_Source_SPW'                             #--- If do_outfile_print = True this will be the prefix of .txt files
                                                    #--- printed the SPW number will be added to this name. [String]

<strong>Once these are set the user can execute this in CASA with execfile('autoWeightChecker.py')</strong>

Expected directory structure:
The expected directory structure is,
<sourcePath>/sources/SOURCE_NAME/ARRAY_TYPE/MEASUREMENT_SETS
